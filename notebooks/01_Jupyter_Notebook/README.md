## Jupyter Development Experience

### How Jupyter Notebooks work
The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text for rapid prototyping. It is often used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and more. To better support exploratory iteration and to accelerate computation of Tensorflow jobs, let's look at how we can include data science tools like Jupyter Notebook with Docker and Kubernetes.

How Jupyter Notebook Infra works
The Jupyter notebook controller spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.
