    "The standard distributed TensorFlow package runs with a parameter server approach to averaging gradients. In this approach, each process has one of two potential roles: a worker or a parameter server. Workers process the training data, compute gradients, and send them to parameter servers to be averaged.\n",

    "- __Identifying the right ratio of worker to parameter servers__. If one parameter server is used, it will likely become a networking or computational bottleneck. If multiple parameter servers are used, the communication pattern becomes “all-to-all” which may saturate network interconnects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Bandwidth is not optimal, network could be the bottleneck__. If model has more parameters, network traffic grow with number of parameters. This is not a scalable solution for large neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Handling increased TensorFlow program complexity__. User has to explicitly start each worker and parameter server, pass around service discovery information such as hosts and ports of all the workers and parameter servers, and modify the training program to construct `tf.Server()` with an appropriate `tf.ClusterSpec()`. Additionally, users had to ensure that all the operations were placed appropriately using `tf.train.device_replica_setter()` and code is modified to use towers to leverage multiple GPUs within the server. This often led to a steep learning curve and a significant amount of code restructuring, taking time away from the actual modeling.\n",

    "In early 2017, Baidu published an article, “Bringing HPC Techniques to Deep Learning,” evangelizing a different algorithm for averaging gradients and communicating those gradients to all nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `ring-allreduce` algorithm, each of N nodes communicates with two of its peers 2*(N-1) times. During this communication, a node sends and receives chunks of the data buffer. In the first N-1 iterations, received values are added to the values in the node’s buffer. In the second N-1 iterations, received values replace the values held in the node’s buffer. Baidu’s paper suggests that this algorithm is bandwidth-optimal, meaning that if the buffer is large enough, it will optimally utilize the available network.\n",
